When working with Prometheus metrics, always follow this workflow:

1. DISCOVERY PHASE:
   - First use prometheus_metric_search to find relevant metrics for the task
   - ALWAYS provide appropriate time ranges for metric discovery:
     * IMPORTANT: Calculate time values before making tool calls - do NOT use expressions in parameters
     * For recency, calculate current_time minus 6 hours (in milliseconds)
     * Example: If current time is 1741166062148, calculate 1741166062148 - 21600000 = 1719566062148
     * Then use concrete values: prometheus_metric_search with start=1719566062148, end=1741166062148
   - Always check the cardinality of labels before using them in queries
   - Identify high cardinality labels (>100 values) and avoid using them directly

2. PLANNING PHASE:
   - Plan which metrics will be most useful for the specific task
   - For each metric, determine the appropriate aggregation functions (sum, avg, max, etc.)
   - Select proper label combinations for grouping that balance detail vs. volume
   - Choose between instant queries (point-in-time) vs. range queries (trends over time)

3. EXECUTION PHASE:
   - Start with the most informative metrics first
   - Use the 'summarize' parameter with a clear intent to get LLM-generated summaries
   - Be careful with broad queries on high-cardinality labels - they can return excessive data
   - For range queries, use appropriate step values to balance resolution vs. data volume

4. ANALYSIS PHASE:
   - Focus on identifying patterns, anomalies, and correlations across metrics
   - Connect metric insights to the original user question
   - Combine insights from multiple metrics to provide a comprehensive understanding

BEST PRACTICES:
- Always include grouping operators (sum by, avg by, etc.) in your PromQL queries
- Use topk() or bottomk() to limit results for high-cardinality metrics
- For time-based analysis, try to align time ranges across different queries
- When using rate() or increase(), ensure sufficient time range for meaningful results
- Start with summary data to get an overview, then drill down into specific areas

EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
1. Search: Calculate time values first, then use prometheus_metric_search with:
   - pattern="node_cpu.*"
   - start=[start_timestamp]
   - end=[end_timestamp]
2. Check cardinality of labels: Verify if 'instance' or 'cpu' have manageable cardinality
3. Plan: "I'll use node_cpu_seconds_total with sum by (mode, instance)"
4. Query with summary: 'prometheus_instant_query with summarize="Identify instances with high CPU usage"'
5. Analyze: "Based on the summary, instance X has Y% utilization in user mode..."
