# Graphite query editor

Grafana includes a Graphite-specific query editor to help you build queries.
The query editor helps you quickly navigate the metric space, add functions, and change function parameters.
It supports a variety of Graphite queries, including complex nested queries, through the use of query references.

For general documentation on querying data sources in Grafana, see [Query and transform data](ref:query-transform-data).

## Query editor elements

- **Series** - Select a metric from the drop-down.

- **Functions** - Graphite uses functions to manipulate data. Click the **+ sign** to view a list of function in the drop-down. You can create a query with multiple functions. 

To view the raw query, click the **Pencil icon** in the upper right. Click the click the **Pencil icon** again to continue adding series and functions.

## Choose metrics to query

Click **Select metric** to navigate the metric space.
Once you begin, you can use the mouse or keyboard arrow keys.
You can also select a wildcard and still continue.

## Functions

Click the **+ sign** next to **Function** to add a function from the drop-down. You can also search by typing the first few letters of the function name. 

After selecting a function, it is added to your query, and your cursor automatically moves to the first parameter field.

To edit a parameter, click it to open an editable text box.

To remove a function simply click on it, then click the **X icon** above it.

 <!-- Once a function is selected, it will be added and your focus will be in the text box of the first parameter.

- To edit or change a parameter, click on it and it will turn into a text box.
- To delete a function, click the function name followed by the x icon. -->

{{< figure src="/static/img/docs/graphite/graphite-functions-still.png" animated-gif="/static/img/docs/graphite/graphite-functions-demo.gif" >}}

Some functions like `aliasByNode` support an optional second argument. To add this argument, hover your mouse over the argument and a dialog box appears. To remove the second optional parameter, click on it to delete it.

Refer to [Functions](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html) in the Graphite documentation for more information. 

{{% admonition type="warning" %}}
Some functions accept a second argument that can itself be another function returning a series. If you need to add a second argument that is a function, Grafana recommends using a series reference from a second query instead of embedding the function directly.

Currently, the query editor does not support parsing a second function argument when switching between the query builder and the code editor.

### Sort labels

If the same labels appear on multiple graphs, they may be sorted differently and assigned different colors.

To ensure consistent sorting and coloring, use the `sortByName()` function to order labels alphabetically.

### Modify the metric name in my tables or charts

Use `alias` functions, such as `aliasByNode()` or `aliasSub()`, to change metric names on Grafana tables or graphs.

### Consolidate data points

Grafana consolidates all Graphite metrics so that Graphite doesn't return more data points than there are pixels in the graph.
By default, Grafana consolidates data points using the `avg` function.
To control how Graphite consolidates metrics, use the Graphite `consolidateBy()` function.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Legend summary values (max, min, total) can't all be correct at the same time because they are calculated client-side by Grafana.
Depending on your consolidation function, only one or two can be correct at the same time.

### Combine time series

To combine time series, click **Combine** in the **Functions** list.

### Select and explore data with tags

In Graphite, _everything_ is a tag.

When exploring data, previously selected tags filter the remaining result set.
To select data, use the `seriesByTag` function, which takes tag expressions (`=`, `!=`, `=~`, `!=~`) to filter timeseries.

The Grafana query builder does this for you automatically when you select a tag.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
The regular expression search can be slow on high-cardinality tags, so try to use other tags to reduce the scope first.
To help reduce the results, start by filtering on a particular name or namespace.

## Nested queries

Grafana lets you reference one query from another using its query letter, similar to how cell references work in a spreadsheet.

For example, if you add a second query and want to build on the results of query A, you can reference it using #A.

This approach allows you to build compound or nested queries, making your panels more flexible and easier to manage.

## Use wildcards to make fewer queries

To display multiple time series on the same graph, use wildcards in your query to return all matching series at once.

For example, to monitor CPU utilization across a variety of metrics, you can use a single query like `cpu.percent.*.g` to retrieve all matching time series.
This approach is more efficient than writing separate queries for each series, such as `cpu.percent.user.g`, `cpu.percent.system.g`, and others, which would result in multiple queries to the data source.

## Apply annotations

[Annotations](ref:annotate-visualizations) overlay rich event information on top of graphs. You can add annotation queries in the dashboard menu's **Annotations** view.

Graphite supports two ways to query annotations:

- A regular metric query, using the `Graphite query` textbox.
- A Graphite events query, using the `Graphite event tags` textbox with a tag, wildcard, or empty value

## Integration with Loki

When you change the data source to Loki in Explore, your Graphite queries are automatically converted to Loki queries. Loki label names and values are extracted based on the mapping information defined in your Graphite data source configuration. Queries that use tags with `seriesByTags()` are also transformed automatically, without requiring any additional setup.
