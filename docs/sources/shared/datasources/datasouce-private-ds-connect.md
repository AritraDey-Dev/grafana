<!-- Procedure for using private data source connect section in the data sources -->

{{\< admonition type="note" \>}}
This feature is only available in Grafana Cloud.
{{\< /admonition \>}}

Use private data source connect (PDC) to connect to and query data within a secure network without opening that network to inbound traffic from Grafana Cloud.

Refer to [Private data source connect](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/connect-externally-hosted/private-data-source-connect/) for more information on how PDC works and [Configure Grafana private data source connect (PDC)](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/connect-externally-hosted/private-data-source-connect/configure-pdc/#configure-grafana-private-data-source-connect-pdc) for steps on setting up a PDC connection.

Use the drop-down list to select a configured private data source. If you make changes, select **Test & save** to preserve your changes.

Use **Manage private data source connect** to configure and manage any private data sources you have configured.
